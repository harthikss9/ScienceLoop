  "summary": "This paper investigates the temperature dependence of protein folding kinetics, focusing on the Arrhenius behavior when adjusted for protein stability effects. By analyzing the folding kinetics of protein L and correcting for temperature effects on protein stability, the study demonstrates a linear relationship between the logarithm of the folding rate and the inverse of temperature. The findings suggest that the non-Arrhenius behavior observed in protein folding kinetics is primarily due to the temperature dependence of the forces driving folding.",
