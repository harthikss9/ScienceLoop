  "summary": "This paper investigates the temperature dependence of protein folding kinetics, specifically examining how this dependence changes when corrected for the effects of temperature on protein stability. The study uses the Arrhenius equation to model the temperature dependence of folding rates and explores two models to interpret the observed linear relationship between the logarithm of the folding rate and the inverse of the temperature on constant stability contours.",
