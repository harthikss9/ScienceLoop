  "expected_outcomes": "The simulation should reveal: (1) For constant denaturant concentration (condition 1), Arrhenius plots (ln(k_fold) vs 1/T) will be non-linear and curved, showing apparent temperature-dependent activation energies due to the temperature dependence of protein stability (DG changes with T). Different denaturant concentrations will produce different curved trajectories. (2) For constant stability (condition 2), where denaturant concentration is adjusted to maintain constant DG across temperatures, Arrhenius plots will be linear with a constant slope, yielding a single, well-defined activation energy independent of temperature. The R-squared value for linear regression should be significantly higher (>0.95) for condition 2 compared to condition 1. (3) The denaturant concentration required to maintain constant stability will increase with temperature (positive correlation), demonstrating that higher temperatures destabilize the protein and require compensatory reduction in denaturant. (4) The activation energy extracted from condition 2 represents the intrinsic temperature dependence of the folding process, separated from stability effects. (5) The difference between conditions 1 and 2 quantitatively demonstrates that non-Arrhenius behavior in protein folding is entirely attributable to temperature-dependent changes in protein stability, validating the paper's central claim that stability-corrected kinetics exhibit simple Arrhenius behavior."
