  "expected_outcomes": "The simulation should reveal: (1) A linear relationship between ln(rate) and 1/T when protein stability is maintained constant through denaturant adjustment, confirming Arrhenius behavior. (2) The slope of the Arrhenius plot should yield an effective activation energy equal to DEa + (m_TS/m)*DG_target, demonstrating that the observed activation energy includes contributions from both configurational diffusion (DEa) and the stability-dependent barrier. (3) The denaturant concentration required to maintain constant stability should increase with temperature, reflecting the temperature dependence of protein stability. (4) Different constant stability contours (different DG_target values) should produce parallel Arrhenius lines with the same slope (same DEa) but different intercepts. (5) Comparison with fixed denaturant concentration should show curved (non-Arrhenius) behavior, highlighting the importance of stability correction. (6) The linearity of the Arrhenius plot validates the hypothesis that configurational diffusion has an Arrhenius temperature dependence and that protein folding kinetics exhibit Arrhenius behavior when corrected for stability effects."
