Define thermodynamic parameters for 3-5 different proteins with varying native state stabilities (different \u0394H, \u0394S, \u0394Cp, m values). Each protein should have distinct stability at reference conditions but potentially share the same \u0394E_a value to test universality.",
    "Step 2: For each protein, compute the native state stability \u0394G(T, [den]=0) at T_0 to verify they have different stabilities. Calculate \u0394G(T, [den]) across a grid of temperatures (278-338 K, 20 points) and denaturant concentrations (0-8 M, 30 points) using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation with heat capacity correction.",
    "Step 3: For each protein and each target stability level \u0394G_target (e.g., -2, 0, 2, 4, 6 kcal/mol), create constant stability contours by solving for [den](T) at each temperature such that \u0394G(T, [den](T)) = \u0394G_target. Use numerical root-finding (scipy.optimize.fsolve or brentq) to find [den] for each T.",
    "Step 4: Calculate the transition state free energy \u0394G_TS(T, [den]) for each protein at each (T, [den]) point using the transition state thermodynamic parameters (\u0394H_U2TS, \u0394S_U2TS, \u0394Cp_U2TS, m_U2TS).",
    "Step 5: Compute folding rates k(T, [den]) for each protein using the full kinetic equation. For stability-corrected analysis, evaluate k(T, [den](T)) along each constant \u0394G contour.",
    "Step 6: Create stability-corrected Arrhenius plots by plotting ln(k) vs 1/T for each protein at each constant \u0394G_target level. Perform linear regression to extract slopes for each protein-stability combination.",
    "Step 7: Test hypothesis - Compare slopes across proteins: (a) If \u0394E_a is universal, all proteins should yield similar slopes at the same \u0394G_target level (within statistical error). (b) Calculate the effective \u0394E_a from each slope using the relationship: slope \u2248 \u0394E_a/R - (m_TS/m)*\u0394G_target/R. (c) Perform statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation) of \u0394E_a values across proteins.",
    "Step 8: Generate visualizations: (a) 2D contour plots of \u0394G(T, [den]) for each protein showing constant stability lines. (b) Stability-corrected Arrhenius plots (ln(k) vs 1/T) for each protein at multiple \u0394G_target values, overlaid on the same axes for comparison. (c) Bar plot or scatter plot showing extracted \u0394E_a values for each protein with error bars. (d) Heatmap showing slope values as a function of protein_id and \u0394G_target.",
    "Step 9: Sensitivity analysis - Vary \u0394E_a systematically for each protein (e.g., protein 1 with \u0394E_a = 4 kcal/mol, protein 2 with \u0394E_a = 6 kcal/mol) to demonstrate what non-universal behavior would look like in the stability-corrected plots.",
    "Step 10: Statistical validation - Perform ANOVA or t-tests to determine if differences in extracted \u0394E_a values across proteins are statistically significant. Calculate R\u00b2 values for linear fits to assess quality of Arrhenius behavior."
  ],
  "expected_outcomes": "If the hypothesis is correct (\u0394E_a is universal), the simulation should reveal: (1) Stability-corrected Arrhenius plots (ln(k) vs 1/T at constant \u0394G) for all proteins will be linear with similar slopes, regardless of their native state stabilities or specific thermodynamic parameters. (2) The extracted \u0394E_a values from the slopes will cluster around a single value (within ~10-15% variation) across all proteins tested. (3) The slopes may vary slightly with \u0394G_target due to the (m_TS/m)*\u0394G_target/R term, but this variation should be consistent across proteins. (4) Proteins with very different native stabilities (e.g., \u0394G at 25\u00b0C ranging from -10 to -2 kcal/mol) will still show convergent \u0394E_a values. (5) The universality will be evident when plotting all proteins' stability-corrected data on the same axes - the lines should be parallel or nearly parallel. If the hypothesis is incorrect, different proteins will show significantly different slopes, indicating that \u0394E_a depends on protein-specific features like sequence, topology, or structural complexity. The simulation will quantify this through statistical measures (coefficient of variation of \u0394E_a across proteins should be <15% for universal behavior, >30% for protein-dependent behavior)."
