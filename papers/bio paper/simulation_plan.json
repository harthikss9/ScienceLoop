  "expected_outcomes": "The simulation should reveal: (1) Linear Arrhenius plots (ln(k) vs 1/T) under constant stability conditions (constant DG), confirming the hypothesis that stability-corrected kinetics follow simple Arrhenius behavior. (2) Non-linear or different slope Arrhenius plots at constant denaturant concentration (uncorrected), demonstrating the effect of stability changes. (3) Systematic differences between corrected and uncorrected activation enthalpies (Delta_DH_activation), with corrected values being more accurate representations of the intrinsic folding barrier. (4) A linear relationship between Delta_DH_activation and DCp_U2TS, confirming that the difference in activation enthalpies is proportional to the heat capacity change of the transition state. (5) The magnitude of Delta_DH_activation should scale with the temperature range and DCp_U2TS value, typically ranging from 5-20 kcal/mol for protein L-like systems. (6) Constant stability contours in (T, den) space should show increasing denaturant concentration with increasing temperature to maintain constant DG, reflecting the temperature-dependent stabilization forces."
