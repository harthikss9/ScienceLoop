  "hypothesis": "For proteins with different native state stabilities, the slope of the stability-corrected Arrhenius plot (ln(rate) vs 1/T at constant \u0394G) will remain constant across proteins, reflecting a universal activation energy for configurational diffusion (\u0394E_a) that is independent of the specific protein sequence or topology.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's key finding that protein folding kinetics exhibit simple Arrhenius behavior when corrected for temperature-dependent stability changes. The knowledge graph shows that 'Stability-corrected Arrhenius plots provide insights into activation energy for configurational diffusion' and that 'Protein folding kinetics exhibit Arrhenius temperature dependence' when corrected for stability. The paper's formula ln(rate) = ln(D0) + \u0394E_a/(RT) - \u0394G_TS/(RT) indicates that at constant stability (constant \u0394G), the slope of ln(rate) vs 1/T should be determined primarily by \u0394E_a, the activation energy for configurational diffusion. If this activation energy represents a fundamental property of the diffusive search process on the energy landscape rather than protein-specific structural features, it should be invariant across different proteins. This is testable by measuring folding rates at multiple temperatures and denaturant concentrations for diverse proteins, constructing stability-corrected Arrhenius plots, and comparing the slopes to determine if \u0394E_a is universal or protein-dependent."
