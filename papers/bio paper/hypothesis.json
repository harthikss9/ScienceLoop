  "hypothesis": "If protein folding kinetics are measured at constant stability (\u0394G) by adjusting denaturant concentration to compensate for temperature changes, then the logarithm of the folding rate will exhibit a linear relationship with inverse temperature (1/T) with a constant activation energy, whereas measurements at constant denaturant concentration will show non-linear Arrhenius plots due to temperature-dependent changes in protein stability.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's central finding that 'the logarithm of the folding rate is a linear function of 1/T on constant stability contours in the temperature-denaturant plane' and that 'the non-Arrhenius behavior observed for folding kinetics is entirely a result of the temperature dependence of the forces driving folding.' The knowledge graph shows that 'Arrhenius behavior is corrected by Protein stability' and 'Non-Arrhenius behavior is a result of Temperature-dependent interactions.' The paper's formula k~T,@gnd#! explicitly models how both temperature and denaturant concentration affect folding rates through their effects on the free energy barrier. This hypothesis is testable by measuring folding rates across a temperature range under two conditions: (1) constant denaturant concentration and (2) denaturant concentrations adjusted to maintain constant \u0394G, then comparing the linearity of Arrhenius plots (ln(k) vs 1/T) between these conditions. The hypothesis is simulation-friendly as it can be modeled using the provided thermodynamic equations relating temperature, denaturant concentration, and free energy."
