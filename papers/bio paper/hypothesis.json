  "hypothesis": "If protein folding rates are measured at different temperatures while maintaining constant protein stability through denaturant concentration adjustment, the logarithm of the folding rate will exhibit a linear relationship with 1/T, demonstrating Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy corresponding to the configurational diffusion constant.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's key finding that 'the logarithm of the folding rate is a linear function of 1/T on constant stability contours in the temperature-denaturant plane' and that 'protein folding kinetics can exhibit Arrhenius behavior when corrected for the temperature dependence of protein stability.' The knowledge graph shows that 'Folding rate is modeled by adjusting the denaturant concentration to maintain constant stability' and that 'Configurational diffusion constant has an Arrhenius temperature dependence.' The formula ln(rate) = ln(D0) + DEa/RT - m_TS/m * DG(T, den)/RT demonstrates that when DG(T, den) is held constant through denaturant adjustment, the rate equation simplifies to an Arrhenius form. This hypothesis is testable through experimental measurements of folding rates at various temperatures with corresponding denaturant concentrations that maintain constant protein stability, and is simulation-friendly as it requires computing folding rates under specified thermodynamic constraints."
