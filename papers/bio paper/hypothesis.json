  "hypothesis": "For proteins with similar structural topology to protein L, the activation enthalpy (\u0394H\u2021) for folding can be accurately determined from the slope of ln(k) versus 1/T plots measured at constant protein stability (constant \u0394G), and this value will differ systematically from activation enthalpies calculated without stability correction by an amount proportional to the heat capacity change (\u0394Cp) of the native state.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's central finding that stability-corrected Arrhenius plots (ln k vs 1/T) are linear under constant stability conditions, as shown in the relationship 'Stability-corrected Arrhenius plots suggest simple temperature dependence of folding kinetics under constant stability conditions'. The paper demonstrates that non-Arrhenius behavior is attributed to 'temperature dependence of interactions that stabilize proteins', and the formula k(T, den) = DF * exp(-((\u0394H_U2TS - T * \u0394S_U2TS + \u0394Cp_U2TS * (T0 - T) * ln(T/T0) + m_U2TS * den) / (R * T))) explicitly includes heat capacity terms that affect the temperature dependence. The hypothesis is testable by measuring folding rates at multiple temperatures and denaturant concentrations to maintain constant \u0394G, extracting activation enthalpies from the linear slopes, and comparing these to uncorrected values. The prediction that the difference scales with \u0394Cp follows from the \u0394Cp_U2TS term in the activation free energy expression and provides a quantitative, measurable relationship."
