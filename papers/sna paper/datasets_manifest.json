  "reasoning": "The simulation plan explicitly mentions network topologies including 'scale_free_BA' (Barab\u00e1si-Albert), 'small_world_WS' (Watts-Strogatz), 'random_ER' (Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi), and 'real_world_networks'. The plan involves k-shell decomposition, degree sequences, neighbors (Gamma(i)), and network analysis. Variables to vary include network_topology, network_size [100, 500, 1000, 2000], and network_parameters with specific values for BA (m=[2,3,4,5]), WS (k=[4,6,8], p=[0.1,0.3,0.5]), and ER (p=[0.01,0.05,0.1]). The procedure explicitly states 'Generate network topologies - Create multiple network instances for each topology type'. Real-world networks are mentioned as a category to test, so common benchmark networks should be included."
