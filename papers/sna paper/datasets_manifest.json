  "reasoning": "The simulation plan explicitly mentions network topologies (scale-free, small-world, random, real-world), uses network-specific terms (k-shell, Gamma(i) for neighbors, nodes, edges), and specifies graph generation parameters in Step 1 (Barab\u00e1si-Albert with m=3, Watts-Strogatz with k=6 and p=0.3, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi with p=0.05). The plan also mentions real-world networks if available. Network sizes are specified as [100, 500, 1000, 2000] nodes."
