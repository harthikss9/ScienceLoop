  "hypothesis": "In complex networks, a node ranking method that combines shell values with sigmoid-transformed iterative information and second-order neighbor degrees, weighted by information entropy, will achieve higher correlation (Kendall's \u03c4) with SIR model propagation outcomes than methods using shell values alone or shell values with only first-order neighbor information.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's core contribution and knowledge graph relationships. The paper demonstrates that: (1) K-shell decomposition is enhanced by iterative information processed through a sigmoid function (p(i) = 1/(1+e^(-sqrt(iter(i))))), which determines node position indices indicating closeness to network core; (2) Position attribute PN_p(i) combines shell values with position indices; (3) Neighbor attribute PN_n(i) aggregates degrees of second-order neighbors to assess influence spread capability; (4) The final influence score PN(i) = w_1*PN_p(i) + w_2*PN_n(i) uses information entropy weighting (w_i = 1 - H_i/(2 - sum(i)H_i)); (5) Node propagation capability is evaluated using the SIR model and assessed through Kendall's coefficient (\u03c4 = (nc - nd)/(0.5*n*(n-1))). The hypothesis is testable by comparing the proposed method against baseline methods (k-shell, k-shell with first-order neighbors) across multiple network topologies, measuring correlation with SIR model results using Kendall's \u03c4 and the imprecision function \u03b5(p)."
