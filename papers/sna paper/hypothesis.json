  "hypothesis": "In complex networks with heterogeneous degree distributions, weighting the position attribute PN_p(i) and neighbor attribute PN_n(i) using information entropy-derived weights (w_1 and w_2) will produce node influence rankings with higher Kendall's coefficient correlation to SIR model propagation outcomes compared to equal weighting or single-attribute methods.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's core methodological innovation where the overall influence score PN(i) = w_1 * PN_p(i) + w_2 * PN_n(i), with weights derived from information entropy (w_i = (1 - H_i)/(2 - \u03a3 H_i)). The knowledge graph shows that 'Overall Influence Score' is 'combined using' 'Information Entropy', and both 'Position Attribute of Node' and 'Neighbor Attribute of Node' are 'weighted by' 'Information Entropy'. The paper evaluates effectiveness using 'Kendall's Coefficient' to measure ranking accuracy against 'SIR Model' propagation capability. This hypothesis is testable by comparing the proposed entropy-weighted method against baseline methods (equal weights, single attributes) across multiple network topologies, measuring performance via Kendall's tau correlation between predicted rankings and actual SIR propagation results."
