  "hypothesis": "In complex networks with heterogeneous k-shell distributions, dynamically adjusting the information entropy weights (w_1, w_2) based on network topology will produce more accurate influential node rankings than fixed weights, as measured by correlation with SIR spreading dynamics.",
  "justification": "The paper establishes that node influence is determined by both position attributes (PN_p) and neighbor attributes (PN_n), combined as PN(i) = w_1 * PN_p(i) + w_2 * PN_n(i). The weights are calculated using information entropy: w_i = (1 - H_i)/(2 - \u03a3 H_i), where H_i = -(1/ln n) \u03a3 r_ij ln r_ij. The knowledge graph shows that 'Information entropy weighting adjusts the weighting of Node position' and 'Neighborhood properties', and that 'Multiattribute k-shell method uses Information entropy weighting'. However, the paper applies a static entropy calculation across all nodes. The hypothesis extends this by proposing that adaptive entropy weighting based on network-specific topological features (such as degree distribution heterogeneity or clustering coefficient variance) could further improve the method's discriminative power. This is testable by comparing fixed entropy weights versus topology-adaptive weights across the same real networks used in the paper's validation, measuring performance through Kendall's tau correlation with SIR model results and monotonicity metrics already established in the methodology."
