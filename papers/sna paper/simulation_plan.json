  "expected_outcomes": "The simulation should reveal that the proposed PN method achieves significantly higher Kendall's tau correlation coefficients (closer to 1.0) with SIR model propagation outcomes compared to both baseline methods across all network topologies. Specifically: (1) k-shell only method should show moderate correlation (tau approximately 0.4-0.6) as it captures basic structural importance but lacks refinement, (2) k-shell with first-order neighbors should show improved correlation (tau approximately 0.6-0.75) by incorporating immediate neighborhood information, (3) proposed PN method should show highest correlation (tau approximately 0.8-0.95) by combining sigmoid-transformed iterative information, second-order neighbor degrees, and entropy-based weighting. The imprecision function epsilon(p) should be lowest for the proposed method across all values of p, indicating better identification of truly influential nodes. The improvement should be most pronounced in scale-free and small-world networks where hierarchical structure and position relative to network core are critical. Results should be consistent across different network sizes, with statistical significance (p < 0.05) confirmed through hypothesis testing. Visualization should clearly demonstrate the superiority of the multi-attribute entropy-weighted approach over simpler methods."
