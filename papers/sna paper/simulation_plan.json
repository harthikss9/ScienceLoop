  "expected_outcomes": "The simulation should reveal that adaptive entropy weighting based on network topology (degree heterogeneity and clustering variance) produces higher Kendall's tau correlations with SIR spreading dynamics compared to fixed entropy weights, particularly in networks with heterogeneous k-shell distributions. Expected patterns: (1) Networks with high degree heterogeneity (scale-free networks) should show greater improvement with adaptive weighting when alpha_degree > 0, (2) Networks with variable clustering (small-world networks) should benefit from alpha_clustering > 0, (3) Optimal alpha values should vary by network type, with combined adaptive schemes (both alpha_degree and alpha_clustering > 0) performing best on heterogeneous networks, (4) Monotonicity metrics should also improve with adaptive weighting, indicating better discriminative power, (5) The improvement should be most pronounced at intermediate beta values (0.10-0.12) where spreading dynamics are most sensitive to node position, (6) Heatmaps should show consistent improvement (darker colors indicating higher tau) for adaptive methods across multiple real networks, validating the hypothesis that topology-aware entropy weighting enhances influential node identification"
