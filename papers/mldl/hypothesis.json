  "hypothesis": "Peptide encoding methods that incorporate supervised feature transformation (PCA or NLF) applied to physicochemical properties of amino acids will achieve at least 5% higher classification accuracy (measured by AUC) compared to traditional encoding methods when tested on peptide classification tasks with sequence lengths between 8-15 amino acids.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from three key relationships in the knowledge graph: (1) 'Novel Peptide Encoding Methods' improve 'Classification Accuracy', (2) 'Novel Peptide Encoding Methods' are based on both 'Physicochemical Properties of Amino Acids' and 'Supervised Feature Transformation', and (3) 'Novel Peptide Encoding Methods' show superior performance compared to 'Traditional Encoding Methods'. The paper's formula Pp_20+k = 1 / (M - k) * sum(a=1 to M-k) [val(p, Aa) - val(p, Aa+k)] demonstrates how physicochemical properties are quantitatively incorporated into the encoding, and the paper explicitly states that supervised feature transformation techniques (PCA and NLF) are applied to derive effective encoding schemes. The hypothesis is measurable using the AUC metric defined in the paper (EUC = 1 - AUC), testable across the multiple classification problems mentioned (HIV-protease, T-cell epitopes, HLA binding peptides), and simulation-friendly as it requires only computational comparison of encoding methods on existing datasets."
