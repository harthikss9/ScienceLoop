  "hypothesis": "Peptide encoding methods that incorporate autocorrelation of physicochemical properties (as defined by Pp(20+k) = (1 / (M - k)) * sum(val(p, Aa) - val(p, Aa+k))) will achieve lower Error Under the ROC Curve (EUC = 1 - AUC) values compared to orthonormal encoding methods when applied to peptide classification tasks using machine learning classifiers.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's key findings and knowledge graph relationships. The paper introduces novel encoding methods based on physicochemical properties (represented by the formula Pp(20+k)) and demonstrates their superiority over traditional methods like orthonormal encoding. The knowledge graph establishes that 'Peptide Classification Effectiveness is dependent on Peptide Encoding Method' and that 'Novel Peptide Encoding Methods show superior results compared to Traditional Peptide Encoding Methods'. The hypothesis is measurable using the EUC metric (defined as EUC = 1 - AUC in the paper), making it quantitatively testable. It is simulation-friendly as it can be computationally validated by comparing classifier performance across different encoding methods on peptide datasets. The hypothesis specifically tests the causal relationship between encoding method choice and classification performance, which is central to the paper's contribution."
