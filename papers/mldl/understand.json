  "summary": "This paper presents two novel peptide encoding methods based on physicochemical properties of amino acids, aiming to improve classification accuracy in peptide-related machine learning tasks. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through extensive comparisons with existing encoding techniques across different classification problems, including HIV-protease, T-cell epitopes, and human leukocyte antigens binding peptides.",
