  "hypothesis": "Increasing the number of nonlinear dynamical complexity measures (including signal fractal scaling exponent and nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation) as input features will improve the classification accuracy of the KNN algorithm for Parkinson's Disease prediction beyond its current performance level.",
  "justification": "The paper establishes that: (1) KNN Algorithm provided the highest accuracy among tested algorithms for PD prediction, (2) Vocal Parameters including nonlinear dynamical complexity measures, signal fractal scaling exponent, and nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation are used as features for PD prediction, (3) Machine Learning Algorithms have varying accuracies depending on the type of algorithm and features used, and (4) the knowledge graph shows that Vocal Parameters are analyzed by Machine Learning Algorithms to predict Parkinson's Disease. Since the paper identifies specific nonlinear features as relevant predictors and demonstrates that algorithm performance varies with feature selection, testing whether expanding the set of nonlinear complexity measures enhances the best-performing algorithm (KNN) is a logical, measurable hypothesis that can be computationally tested by systematically adding nonlinear features and measuring classification accuracy metrics."
