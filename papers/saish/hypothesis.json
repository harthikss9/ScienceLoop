  "hypothesis": "Increasing the ratio of noise to tonal components in vocal parameters will decrease the prediction accuracy of machine learning algorithms for Parkinson's Disease classification, with the magnitude of accuracy reduction varying systematically across different algorithm types (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression).",
  "justification": "This hypothesis is grounded in three key relationships from the knowledge graph and paper content: (1) 'Vocal parameters influence Prediction accuracy' - establishing that changes in vocal features directly affect model performance, (2) 'Prediction accuracy is dependent on Vocal data quality' - indicating that degraded signal quality impacts outcomes, and (3) 'Machine learning algorithms determine Classification accuracy' - showing that different algorithms respond differently to input features. The ratio of noise to tonal components is explicitly identified as a variable 'used to determine the quality of voice and its degradation' in the paper. Since this ratio quantifies signal quality degradation (a key aspect of PD-affected voices), systematically varying it allows testing how vocal data quality affects each algorithm's performance. This hypothesis is measurable through controlled experiments where the noise-to-tonal ratio is manipulated across a range of values, and prediction accuracy is measured for each of the five algorithms mentioned in the paper, making it both testable and simulation-friendly."
