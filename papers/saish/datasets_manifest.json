  "reasoning": "The simulation plan explicitly mentions loading or generating a synthetic vocal parameter dataset with 195 samples, 16 vocal features, and binary health status labels (PD=1, healthy=0). The procedure requires baseline NTR values and all 16 vocal features including fundamental frequency measures, amplitude variations, NTR, and nonlinear complexity measures. This is a classification problem requiring synthetic data generation with specific feature characteristics for Parkinson's Disease detection."
