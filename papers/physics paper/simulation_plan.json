    "Step 2: For each combination of (v_rot, inclination, beta_model): (a) Compute the 3D wind velocity field v(r, theta) using the beta law with rotation effects; (b) Compute the wind density distribution rho(r, theta) with gravity darkening g(theta) = 1 + alpha * cos(theta)^2 to account for polar enhancement in fast rotators",
    "Step 3: Generate synthetic line profiles by integrating emission over the visible stellar hemisphere: (a) Set up spherical grid (r, theta, phi) from R_star to 5*R_star; (b) For each grid point, compute projected velocity v_proj including both wind velocity and rotational velocity; (c) Compute emission coefficient proportional to rho(r, theta)^2 for optically thin lines; (d) Project onto velocity space accounting for inclination angle i; (e) Convolve with instrumental profile",
    "Step 4: Fit the synthetic line profiles to extract observed beta_obs: (a) Use least-squares fitting to match profile shape with beta law; (b) Record beta_obs for each (v_rot, inclination) combination; (c) Compare beta_obs to input beta_model to quantify viewing angle effects",
    "Step 5: Compute wind momentum D_mom = M_dot * V_inf * R_star^0.5 for each model, adjusting M_dot for rotation effects using M_dot(v_rot) = M_dot_base * (1 + 0.3 * (v_rot/v_crit)^2) to account for enhanced equatorial mass loss",
    "Step 6: Test the hypothesis by analyzing results: (a) For fast rotators (v_rot > 200 km/s) at low inclination (i < 30\u00b0), verify that beta_obs > 1.5; (b) For slow rotators or high inclination, verify that beta_obs \u2248 0.8-1.0; (c) Plot log(D_mom) vs log(L_star/L_sun) for all models and verify they follow the same WLR with slope \u2248 1.8-2.0 regardless of rotation/inclination",
    "Step 7: Generate visualizations: (a) 2D heatmap of beta_obs vs (v_rot, inclination); (b) Line profile comparison for fast rotator at i=10\u00b0 vs i=70\u00b0; (c) Wind momentum-luminosity diagram showing all models collapse onto single relation; (d) Contour plot showing regions where beta_obs > 1.5 in (v_rot, inclination) space",
    "Step 8: Quantify systematic effects: (a) Calculate mean beta_obs for fast rotators (v_rot > 200 km/s) at i < 30\u00b0 and compare to slow rotators; (b) Compute scatter in WLR for different rotation/inclination combinations; (c) Determine critical rotation velocity and inclination angle where beta_obs transitions from normal to elevated values"

  "expected_outcomes": "The simulation should reveal: (1) A strong dependence of observed beta (beta_obs) on the combination of rotation velocity and inclination angle, with fast rotators (v_rot > 200 km/s) viewed at low inclination (i < 30\u00b0) showing systematically elevated beta_obs > 1.5, while slow rotators or high-inclination systems show beta_obs \u2248 0.8-1.0. (2) Synthetic line profiles for fast rotators at low inclination should exhibit enhanced emission at intermediate velocities due to the superposition of wind regions with different velocities and densities, mimicking a steeper velocity law. (3) Despite the variation in observed beta, all models should follow the same wind momentum-luminosity relationship when plotted as log(D_mom) vs log(L_star), with a tight correlation (scatter < 0.3 dex) and slope consistent with radiatively driven wind theory (\u22481.8-2.0). (4) A clear transition region in (v_rot, inclination) parameter space where beta_obs increases from normal to elevated values, demonstrating that the high beta observed in GHV-62024 is indeed an artifact of viewing geometry rather than a fundamental change in wind physics. (5) The 2D heatmap should show a diagonal pattern where the combination of high rotation and low inclination produces the highest beta_obs values, validating the paper's interpretation that GHV-62024's unusual properties result from being a fast rotator seen nearly pole-on."
