  "summary": "This paper presents a detailed analysis of GHV-62024, an O6.5 IIIf star in the low-metallicity galaxy IC 1613, using observations from VIMOS at VLT and the model atmosphere code FASTWIND. The study investigates the star's wind momentum, luminosity relationship, and evolutionary status, suggesting that the star is a fast rotator seen at a low inclination angle, which affects the wind velocity law exponent (\u03b2). The results support the theory of radiatively driven winds at low metallicities and provide insights into the effects of fast rotation on stellar wind properties.",
  "formulas": [
    "D_mom = M_dot * V_inf * R^(1/2)",
    "Q = M_dot / (V_inf * R_star)^(3/2)",
    "log(D_mom) = log(M_dot * V_inf * R^(0.5))",
    "log(D_mom) = 2.5 * log(V_inf) + 2 * log(R) + log(Q)"

    "Wind momentum-luminosity relationship (WLR) depends primarily on stellar luminosity and metallicity.",
    "The exponent of the wind velocity law (\u03b2) and the mass-loss rate (M_dot) have different effects on the line profiles, influencing the emission at low and high velocities respectively.",
    "High \u03b2 values may be an artifact caused by the superposition of light emitted from regions with different wind properties in fast rotators seen at low inclination angles.",
    "Nitrogen and helium abundances are indicative of strong CNO mixing, potentially due to fast rotation."

  "key_ideas": [
    "The peculiar Of star GHV-62024 follows the expected wind momentum-luminosity relationship for its metallicity when considering a high \u03b2 value, which may be due to its fast rotation seen at a low inclination angle.",
    "The high \u03b2 value, unusual for stars of this type, is suggested to be an artifact from viewing a fast rotator at a low inclination, affecting the wind velocity profiles.",
    "The analysis supports the theory of radiatively driven winds at low metallicities and extends its confirmation beyond the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) metallicities.",
    "The findings suggest that fast rotation can significantly alter the wind structure and properties of massive stars without changing the global wind momentum-luminosity relationship."
