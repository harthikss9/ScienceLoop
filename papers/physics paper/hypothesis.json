  "hypothesis": "For O-type stars in low-metallicity environments (Z < 0.2 Z_solar), an increase in the exponent of the wind velocity law (\u03b2) from 0.8 to 2.0 will result in a measurable decrease in the He II 4686 emission line equivalent width while maintaining consistency with the wind momentum-luminosity relationship, provided that the mass-loss rate (Mdot) is adjusted proportionally to maintain constant Q-parameter.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from three key relationships established in the paper: (1) The interdependence between mass-loss rate and the exponent \u03b2, which are 'crucial for fitting the He II 4686 line profile' as stated in the knowledge graph; (2) The finding that GHV-62024 required a high \u03b2 value of 2.0 to fit the He II 4686 emission profile, indicating 'slower acceleration in the inner wind'; (3) The star's adherence to the wind momentum-luminosity relationship despite this unusual \u03b2 value. The hypothesis is testable through FASTWIND model simulations by systematically varying \u03b2 while adjusting Mdot to maintain the Q-parameter (Q = Mdot / (Vinf * R^1.5)) constant, then measuring the resulting He II 4686 emission profiles. This tests whether the observed high \u03b2 value is a general property of low-metallicity stellar winds rather than specific to GHV-62024, and whether the WLR remains valid across different \u03b2 regimes."
