  "hypothesis": "For massive O-type stars with fast rotation (v sin i > 200 km/s) viewed at inclination angles < 30\u00b0, the observed exponent of the wind velocity law (\u03b2) will be systematically higher (\u03b2 > 1.5) compared to slow rotators or high-inclination systems (\u03b2 \u2248 0.8-1.0), while maintaining the same global wind momentum-luminosity relationship when corrected for viewing geometry.",
  "justification": "This hypothesis directly follows from the paper's key finding that GHV-62024's unusually high \u03b2 value is suggested to be an artifact from viewing a fast rotator at a low inclination angle (as shown in the knowledge graph edge: 'Exponent of the wind velocity law' -> 'is suggested to be an artifact from' -> 'Viewing angle of fast rotators'). The paper demonstrates that despite this high \u03b2, the star still follows the expected wind momentum-luminosity relationship (edge: 'GHV-62024' -> 'follows' -> 'Wind momentum-luminosity relationship'). The hypothesis is testable through spectroscopic observations of O-type stars with varying rotation rates and inclination angles, or through 3D radiative transfer simulations incorporating rotation effects. It quantifies the relationship between rotation, viewing angle, and the \u03b2 parameter while predicting that the fundamental WLR (dependent on stellar luminosity and metallicity) remains unchanged, consistent with the paper's conclusion that fast rotation alters wind structure without changing the global wind momentum-luminosity relationship."
